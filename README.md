# assignment
This program is targeted to java 12.
Please have your local set up with java 12.

I have 2 JUnit for each of the problem.

Please feel free to add a main method to each of the 
Problem1.java and Problem2.Java to test files of your own.

Or, you can add the path of the files in the junit classes as well. 

Note : I am creating the file and deleting them in the junit itself.

## Other Ideas

We can use ZooKeeper to read file parallel and send the data to kafka note for faster process.
and we can implement failsafe and multiple time processing selective nodes.
